# World Data Directory

⚠️ **WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY MANUALLY** ⚠️

This directory contains automatically generated world data files. These files are generated by the scripts/generate-world.ps1 script and will be overwritten when the script is run again.

If you need to modify the world data:
1. Make changes to the source data in the countries-states-cities-database submodule
2. Run the scripts/generate-world.ps1 script to regenerate the files

## Structure
- WorldData.cs - Main entry point containing all countries
